The implementation follows industry best practices for encryption, password hashing, and request logging.
- Security measures such as AES encryption and Argon2 password hashing ensure robust protection of sensitive data.
- Authentication request logging provides visibility into server access, aiding in monitoring and security analysis.
- The optional rate limiter adds an additional layer of defense against potential attacks or misuse of the authentication endpoint.
